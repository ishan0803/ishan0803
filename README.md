## 👋 About Me

I’m a systems-focused undergraduate at **VIT Pune** with a strong interest in  
**operating systems, networking, concurrency, and performance-critical C++**.

I enjoy working close to the machine, understanding how systems behave under load,  
and improving them using **measurement, profiling, and careful design**.

## 📌 What I’m Working On

- Building small, focused **C++ projects** to explore concurrency, memory, and performance
- Studying OS and networking internals by **reading source code and writing experiments**
- Practicing competitive programming to improve **speed and correctness**

Pinned repositories reflect this work.

## 🤝 Open Source & Collaboration

I’m interested in contributing to:
- OS / kernel-adjacent projects
- Networking stacks and infrastructure
- Performance-sensitive C++ codebases
- Tooling, benchmarks, and profiling infrastructure

Open to beginner-friendly issues and performance-oriented contributions in systems projects.
